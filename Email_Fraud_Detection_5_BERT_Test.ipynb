This is slightly lower than the test accuracy of the best tuned logistic regression model which is 97.3%. Despite the slightly lower accuracy I expect that the BERT model would be better for fraudulent email identification due to the fact it is not as reliant upon specific words and can better identify the context of words. The performance of the BERT model will be further examined by looking at its confusion matrix and the types of emails it incorrectly identifies."

    "Looking at the messages the model identified as false negatives, there appears to be two prominent patterns. The first pattern is that the model does not properly flag fraud emails which tend to be lengthy where the sender pretends to be from an obscure organization or government institution. The other type of fraud emails incorrectly identified are those that tend to be short with no strong indicating words and a link for the user to follow. It is possible the length emails could be properly identified by a larger BERT model with more training, but it is unlikely the short emails could be identified without additional code built to feed this information along with the BERT model into a new model."

    "Examining the messages the model falsely identified as fraud reveals several commonalities. The first of these is that many of the messages falsely flagged typical relate to governments or finances. This makes sense since many fraud emails relate to these subjects. In addition to this, some messages which relate to downloading files or opening links have also been falsely flagged. This also makes sense since fraud emails tend to encourage this type of activity to trick victims into providing sensitive information or download viruses. It may be difficult to train a model to differentiate these types of emails from truly fraudulent ones without incorporating information about the sender, but it is possible with more data and training that this could be improved."

    "Despite the fact that the BERT model has slightly worse performance than the best tuned linear regression model, the BERT model is still the model that is recommended for use as a fraud email identifier. This is largely due to the fact that it is much more generally applicable due to its use of word embeddings. This is especially important since criminals who use these fraud schemes constantly change their strategies and if they become aware of specific words causing their emails to be flagged as fraud, they will simply stop using those words. The other advantage the BERT model has is the ability for it to distinguish the context of a word, thus just because a certain word appears, the model will not automatically identify the email as fraud. Thus, this BERT model represents a good start for a model that could be used for classifying an email as fraud or not, solely based on its text content."
