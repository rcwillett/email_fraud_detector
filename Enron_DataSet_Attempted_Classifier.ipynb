Venki Venkateshwara DATE: March 27, 2001 California Power Crisis Update No. 10 DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK, 3/23/2001 The weeks highlights include: Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply.

Venki Venkateshwara DATE: March 27, 2001 California Power Crisis Update No. 10 DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK, 3/23/2001 The weeks highlights include: Continued indications that the issue of market power and possible remedies for it is likely to remain a high profile issue in California and elsewhere both retroactively and prospectively An ironical situation with respect to QFs in which QF power under contract is effectively being released into the market at higher prices A court order requiring Reliant to continue to sell power to the ISO even if it is not being paid in a full and timely manner Another Stage 3 emergency and rolling blackouts Market power There are continued indications that the issue of market power will not be settled simply. This week there was a lengthy and politically influential front page story in the New York Times about FERCs passive approach to policing generators Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency Is Weak in Oversight of Utilities. The story was by Jeff Gerth and Joseph Kahn. Jeff Gerths 1992 story on the Whitewater deal is viewed by journalists to have been the origin of what eventually became a multi-year investigation of Bill Clinton. The key issues are familiar: Does market power exist to a degree that warrants remedies such as price caps, refunds, and so on If so, what is the basis for asserting that market power exists and what is the remedy See the discussion in the New York Times article on the good hours vs. bad hours approach and the associated political decision not to deal with good hours. Can market power be used as leverage to eventually settle generator bills in C...   \n",

The awards, sponsored by publishing and information company Platts and the professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, recognized Duke Energy for its diversified operations and its successful overall growth during the past year. Analysis: 2001 may turn out to be the most tumultuous year in the history of the energy industry, and certainly the most volatile since deregulation began about four years ago. However, in the course of a year that has witnessed the bankruptcy filings of two leading energy companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Enron, Duke Energys success during the same time frame is all the more impressive. In addition to earnings that consistently meet or exceed expectations, Duke has carved out a unique niche in the energy merchant space, the same market in which its competitor Enron has now failed. The pending acquisition of Vancouver-based Westcoast Energy should also add to Dukes already-diverse portfolio, give it a lock on Canadas seemingly abundant gas reserve fields, and expand the companys North American pipeline capacity. However, in my estimation, the real significance of Dukes performance is the strategy that is working behind the scenes at this company. While more energy companies continue to announce massive restructuring plans-dividing up their regulated and unregulated businesses-Duke remains intact. Further, while other companies become more focused on a primary fuel source natural gas, coal or nuclear, Duke remains broadly diversified.

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am very interested in moving into this area.

The file there are three worksheets labelled as follows: Total Reqs: Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled NOM. The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point. The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice. CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\\Energy Ops\\Enron\\May00\\Daily\\ .xls, so you dont have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. Daily Change : shows the change increase /decrease - in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous days volume request for the current day e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28. Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was in fact effectuated. For tomorrows gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the future days shown. e.g., If today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27. This sheet should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back. The column labelled ENA Daily Swing /- vs FOM volume shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at pre-specified prices.

       "11266  The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 5/31 and the following days as listed . The file there are three worksheets labelled as follows: Total Reqs: Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled NOM. The Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at a specific point. The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until further notice. CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on P:\\Energy Ops\\Enron\\May00\\Daily\\ .xls, so you dont have to save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network. Daily Change : shows the change increase /decrease - in the daily volume needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. For the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous days volume request for the current day e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28.

To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list, just send mail to RRGA-LLIST.RTOWEST.ORG. This is called sending mail to the list, because you send mail to a single address and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people who have subscribed. This address RRGA-LLIST.RTOWEST.ORG is also called the list address. You must never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed.

The Tennessee Valley Authority NYSE:TVBNYSE:TVC recently started construction of the nations first large scale power storage facility at a two acre site off of Highway 373 just east of the Air Force Base near Columbus, MS. Construction of the $25 million facility is expected to take 18-24 months to complete, creating roughly 60 jobs before the project is finished in 2003. This innovative energy-storage plant is designed to improve power reliability and customer service, have limited environmental impact and contribute to economic growth for consumers in Mississippi and throughout the Tennessee Valley, says TVA Chairman Glenn McCullough Jr. TVA continues to set the pace for energy production and demonstrate its role as a national leader in the use of cutting-edge, 21st-Century technologies. The plant was designed by Regenesys Technologies Limited, part of Innogy plc UK and utilizes regenerative fuel cell technology. During periods of low electrical demand the cells are charged with electricity generated at other locations. The stored energy is then released during times of demand. The power storage facility is designed to store up to 120 megawatt-hours of energy and will be capable of providing p...   \n",
